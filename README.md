🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 — Structure and layout

CSS3 — Styling and button design

JavaScript — Event handling and dynamic class changes

🧠 How It Works
Each button has a specific class like .red-btn, .blue-btn, etc.

When a button is clicked:

JavaScript adds the corresponding background class (e.g., red-bg) to the <body> element.

It also removes other background classes to ensure only one background is applied at a time.

🚀 How to Use
Download or clone the repository.

Open background.html in any modern web browser.

Click on the buttons to see the background color change instantly.
